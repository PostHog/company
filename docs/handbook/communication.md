# Communication

## Introduction

We're an all-remote company that allows people to work from almost anywhere in the world. We hire great people regardless of where they live, but with team members across several countries, it's important for us to practice clear communication in ways that help us stay connected and work more efficiently.

To accomplish this, we use **asynchronous communication as a starting point** and stay as open and transparent as we can by communicating through public issues, merge requests and (minimally) Slack.

We also place an emphasis on ensuring that conclusions of offline conversations are written down.

When we go **back and forth three times,** we jump on a synchronous video call.

We communicate respectfully and professionally at all times.

## Effective & Responsible Communication Guidelines

1. **Assume Positive Intent.** Always being with a position of positivity and grace.
1. **Kindness Matters.** You are looking at a screen, but you are really talking to a person. If you wouldn't say it to a person's face, don't send it to them in a text message.
1. **Express Your Thoughts.** We live in different locations and often have very different perspectives. We want to know your thoughts, opinions, and feelings on things.
1. **Own It.** If you say it or type it, own it. If it hurts the company or an individual, even unintentionally, we encourage you to look at things from other points of view and apologize easily.
1. **Be a Role Model of our Values.**
1. **Feedback is Essential.** Help everyone up their game, in a direct but constructive way.
1. **Don't Underestimate a 1:1.** Asynchronous communication (e.g., via text) is helpful and necessary. In some cases (e.g., to clarify misunderstandings) it can be much more effective to jump on a Zoom video call.
1. **Always Adhere to our Anti-Harassment Policy and Code of Conduct.** Everyone should be comfortable in their work environment.

## Everyone is a Moderator

If you see something that concerns you in Slack, Issues, Merge Requests, Video, Emails or any other forum, we encourage you to respectfully say something directly to the individual in a 1:1 format. If you are not comfortable reaching out to the individual directly, please reach out to your direct manager or People Business Partner to discuss.

## External communication

There are 8 key practices to consider during any meeting. They are the following:

1. Video Calls - If this is your first time meeting a customer/prospect/partner/etc., turn on your camera when you login to Zoom. This will help to make the customer/prospect feel more comfortable as they are certain your undivided attention is geared towards them.
1. Agenda - Always have an agenda prepped and ready to go. Share this with your audience. Make sure that everything on the agenda is accurate and ask if there’s anything missing that needs to be addressed during this call or for the future. When there is no agenda, it translates to you not caring.
1. 70/30 Rule - Ask open ended questions that leave the audience talking 70% of the time, while you are talking 30% of the time. Please note that this varies based on the type of meeting that you are conducting. Be conscious of what questions needs to be asked and to capture those items.
1. Take Notes - Effective note-taking is a valuable skill that will help you retain and recall any important details. Be the person who remembers all the details of your audience's needs.
1. Adapt to Audience Tone - Before going into the business portion of your meeting, evaluate first the tone of the audience. Adapt your tone accordingly in order to appeal to various types of personalities.
1. Mid-call - Half-way through the meeting, check in with your audience. Ask them what their thoughts are on the progression of this meeting and if what you're presenting is on the right track. This helps both you and the audience by re-aligning expectations and making sure the meeting is going the right direction. 
1. Pre-Close Summary - 10 Minutes (1-hour meetings) or 5 minutes (30 minute meetings) prior to ending the call, ask the audience to build out an agenda for the next step or meeting. This helps to secure next steps and to ensure there are no balls dropped.
1. Post Meeting Action - Immediately write down notes and next steps and input into proper directory (Google Drive, Salesforce, etc.).
1. Two Block Rule - For in person meetings with external parties you should wait until you're more than two blocks from the meeting before discussing the results of the meeting. Nobody wants to hear themselves being discussed in the bathroom.

## Everything starts with a Merge Request

It's best practice to start a discussion where possible with a Merge Request (MR) instead of an issue. An MR is associated with a specific change that is proposed and transparent for everyone to review and openly discuss. The nature of MRs facilitate discussions around a proposed solution to a problem that is actionable. An MR is actionable, while an issue will take longer to take action on.

1. Always **open** an MR for things you are suggesting and/or proposing. Whether something is not working right or we are iterating on new internal process, it is worth opening a merge request with the minimal viable change instead of opening an issue encouraging open feedback on the problem without proposing any specific change directly. Remember, an MR also invites discussion, but it's specific to the proposed change which facilitates focused decision.
1. Starting with a Merge Request is part of Handbook First and helps ensure the handbook is up-to-date when a decision is made.
1. Merge Requests, by default are **non-confidential**. However, for things that are not public by default please open a confidential issue with suggestions to specific changes that you are proposing. When possible, consider not including sensitive information so the wider community can contribute.
1. Not every solution will solve the problem at hand. Keep discussions focused by **defining the problem first** and **explaining your rationale** behind the Minimal Viable Change (MVC) proposed in the MR.
1. Be proactive and consistent with communication on discussions that have external stakeholders such as customers. It's important to keep communication flowing to keep everyone up to date. MRs can appear stale if there aren't recent discussions and no clear definition on when another update will be provided, based on feedback. This leaves those subscribed in the dark, causing unnecessary surprise if something ends up delayed and suddenly jumps to the next milestone. It is important that MRs are closed in a timely manner through approving or rejecting the open requests.
1. Have a **bias for action** and don't aim for consensus. Every MR is a proposal, if an MRs author isn't responsive take ownership of it and complete it. Some improvement is better than none.
1. **Cross link** issues or other MRs with related conversations. And when approving or rejecting the MR, include reason or response from ZenDesk. Put the link at the top of each MR's description with a short mention of the relationship (Report, Dependency, etc.) and use one as the central one and ideally close the alternate if duplicate.
1. If submitting a change for a feature, **update the description with the final conclusions** (Why an MR was rejected or why it was approved). This makes it much easier to see the current state of an issue for everyone involved in the implementation and prevents confusion and discussion later on.
1. Submit the **smallest** item of work that makes sense. When proposing a change, submit the smallest reasonable commit, put suggestions for other enhancements in separate issues/MRs and link them. If you're new to PostHog and are writing documentation or instructions, submit your first merge request for at most 20 lines.
1. Do not leave MRs open for a long time. MRs should be **actionable** -- stakeholders should have a clear understanding of what changed and what they are ultimately approving or rejecting.
1. Make a conscious effort to **prioritize** your work. The priority of items depends on multiple factors: Is someone waiting for the answer? What is the impact if you delay it? How many people does it affect, etc.?
1. When submitting a MVC, **ask for feedback** from your peers. For example, if you're a designer and you propose a design, ping a fellow designer to review your work. If they suggest changes, you get the opportunity to improve your design and propose an alternative MR. This promotes collaboration and advances everyone's skills.
1. Respond to comments within a **threaded discussion**. If there isn't a discussion thread yet, you can use the reply to comment button from the comments to create one. This will prevent comments from containing many interweaves discussions with responses that are hard to follow.
1. If your comment or answer contains separate topics, write separate comments for each, so others can address topics independently using the Reply to comment button.
1. Even when something is not done, share it internally so people can comment early and prevent rework.
1. Create a **Work In Progress (WIP)** merge request to prevent an accidental early merge. Only use WIP when merging it would **make things worse**, which should rarely be the case when contributing to the handbook. Most merge requests that are in progress don't make things worse, in this case don't use WIP, if someone merges it earlier than you expected just create a new merge request for additional items. Never ask someone to do a final review or merge something that still have WIP status, at that point you should be convinced it is good enough to go out.
1. If any follow up actions are required on the issue after the merge request is merged (like reporting back to any customers or writing documentation), avoid auto closing the issue.
1. If a project requires multiple approvals to accept your MR, feel free to assign multiple reviewers concurrently. This way the earliest available reviewer can start right away rather than being blocked by the preceding reviewer.

## Issues

Issues are useful when there isn't a specific code change that is being proposed or needed. For example, you may want to start an issue for tracking progress or for project management purposes that do not pertain to code commits. This can be particularly useful when tracking team tasks and creating issue boards. However it is still important to maintain focus when opening issues by defining a single specific topic of discussion as well as defining the desired outcome that would result in the resolution of the issue. The point is to not keep issues open-ended and to prevent issues from going stale due to lack of resolution. For example, a team member may open an issue to track the progress of a blog post with associated to-do items that need to be completed by a certain date (e.g. first draft, peer review, publish). Once the specific items are completed, the issue can successfully be closed. Below are a few things to remember when creating issues:

 1. When **closing** an issue leave a comment explaining why you are closing the issue and what the MVC outcome was of the discussion (if it was implemented or not).
 1. We keep our **promises** and do not make external promises without internal agreement.
 1. Be proactive and consistent with communication on discussions that have external stakeholders such as customers. It's important to keep communication flowing to keep everyone up to date. Issues can appear stale if there aren't recent discussions and no clear definition on when another update will be provided, based on feedback. This leaves those subscribed in the dark, causing unnecessary surprise if something ends up delayed and suddenly jumps to the next milestone. It is important that issues are closed in a timely manner. One way of doing this is having the current assignee set a due date for when they will provide another update. This can be days or weeks ahead depending on the situation, prioritization, and available capacity that we may have.
 1. If a user suggests an enhancement, try and find an existing issue that addresses their concern, or create a new one. Ask if they'd like to elaborate on their idea in an issue to help define the first MVC via a subsequent MR.
 1. **Cross link** issues or MRs with related conversations. Another example is to add "Report: " lines to the issue description with links to relevant issues and feature requests. When done, add a comment to relevant issues (and close them if you are responsible for reporting back, or re-assign if you are not). This prevents internal confusion and us failing to report back to the reporters.
 1. Prioritize your work on issues in the current milestone.
 1. Assign an issue to yourself as soon as you start to work on it, but not before that time. If you complete part of an issue and need someone else to take the next step, **re-assign** the issue to that person.
 1. Ensure the issue **title** states what the desired outcome should be.  For instance, for bugs make sure the issue states the desired result, not the current behavior.
 1. **Regularly update** the issue description with the latest information and its current status, especially when important decisions were made during the discussion. The issue description should be the **single source of truth**.
 1. If you want someone to review an issue, do not assign them to it. Instead, @-mention them in an issue comment. Being assigned to an issue is a signal that the assignee should or intends to work on it. So you should not assign someone to an issue and mis-represent this with a false signal.
 1. Do not close an issue until it is **done**. It's okay to explicitly ask if everyone is on board and in agreement on how to move forward, whether to iterate, close the open issue, or create a subsequent MR to implement a MVC.
 1. Once a feature is **done**, update the description to add a link to the corresponding documentation. When using a Search Engine, issues often appear before documentation pages, which makes it harder to find the relevant information about the feature.
 1. Write issues so that they exclude private information. This way, the issue can be public. Only use confidential issues, if the issue must contain non-public information. You can link to our CRM records if you want to reference a particular customer or user.
 1. If the content within a public issue transitions to become what is deemed confidential non-public information, the issue may be made confidential.
 
## Internal Communication

1. All written communication happens in English, even when sent one on one, because sometimes you need to forward an email or chat.
1. Use **asynchronous communication** when possible: merge requests (preferred) or issues. Announcements happen on the appropriate slack channels and [people should be able to do their work without getting interrupted by chat](https://m.signalvnoise.com/is-group-chat-making-you-sweat-744659addf7d#.21t7089jk).
1. Discussion in issues or Merge Requests is preferred over everything else. If you need a response urgently, you can Slack someone with a link to your comment on an issue or merge request, asking them to respond there, however be aware that they still may not see it straight away. See [Slack](/handbook/communication#slack) for more.
1. If you choose to email instead of chat it is OK to send an _internal_ email that contains only a short message, similar as you would use in chat.
1. You are not expected to be available all the time. There is no expectation to respond to messages outside of your planned working hours.
1. Sometimes synchronous communication is the better option, but do not default to it. For example, a video call can clear things up quickly when you are blocked.
1. It is very OK to ask as many questions as you have. Please ask them so many people can answer them and many people see the answer, so use issues or public chat channels instead of private messages or one-on-one emails. If someone sends you a handbook link they are proud that we have the answer documented, they don't mean that you should have found that yourself or that this is the complete answer, feel free to ask for clarification. If the answer to a question isn't documented yet please immediately make a merge request to add it to the handbook in a place you have looked for it. It is great for the person who answered the question to see you help to ensure they have to answer it only once. A merge request is the best way to say thanks for help.
1. If you mention something (a merge request, issue, commit, webpage, comment, etc.) please include a link to it.
1. All company data should be **shareable** by default. Don't use a local text file but rather leave comments on an issue.
1. When someone asks something, give back a deadline or that you did it. Answers like: 'will do', 'OK', 'it is on my todo list' are not helpful. If it is small it's better to spend 2 minutes and do the tasks so the other person can mentally forget about it. If it is large you need to figure out when you'll do it, by returning that information the other person might decide to solve it in another way if it takes too long.
1. It is OK to bring an issue to someone's attention with a CC ("cc @user"), but CCs alone are not enough if specific action is needed from someone. The mentioned user may read the issue and take no further action. If you need something, please explicitly communicate your need along with @ mentioning who you need it from.
1. Avoid creating private groups for internal discussions:
    1. It's disturbing (all users in the group get notified for each message).
    1. It's not searchable.
    1. It's not shareable: there is no way to add people in the group (and this often leads to multiple groups creation).
    1. They don't have a subject, so everyone has to remember the topic of each private group based on the participants, or open the group again to read the content.
    1. History is lost when leaving the group.
1. It is perfectly fine to create a channel, even for a single customer meeting. These channels should be named "a_&lt;customer-name&gt;-internal" to indicate their "internal" nature (not shared with customers).
1. Use [low-context communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-context_and_low-context_cultures) by being explicit in your communications. We are a remote-only company, located all over the world. Provide as much context as possible to avoid confusion. Relatedly, we use [ubiquitous language](#ubiquitous-language) for communication efficiency.
1. When discussing concepts, be careful not to lean too much into hypotheticals. There is a tipping point in which it decreases value and no longer becomes constructive at helping everyone come into a unified decision.


### Not Public

We make things public by default because [transparency is part of Communication, one of our values](/handbook/values/#communication).

However it is [most important to focus on results](/handbook/values/#results).
So most things are **public** unless there is a reason not to. The following items are not public by default:

1. Security vulnerabilities are not public since it would allow attackers to compromise PostHog installations. We do make them public after we remediated a vulnerability. Issues that discuss how to improve upon the security posture of an implementation that is working as intended can be made public, and are often labeled as feature proposals. Security implementations that detect malicious activities cannot be made public because doing so would undermine our operations.
1. Financial information, including revenue and costs for the company, is confidential because we plan to be a public company one day and, as such, need to limit both the timing and content of financial information as investors will use and rely on it one day as they trade in our stock. As a rule of thumb, if it is a first step to constructing a profit, we need to keep it confidential. Examples include:
   1. the specific contract value of an opportunity
   1. total monthly cash inflow/outflow
   1. Spend of more than 10%
   1. a department's cost
   1. the Sales pipeline (but the Marketing pipeline can be public)
   1. Net and Gross Retention KPIs (only the actual numbers can't be public. Everything else- the goal, their calculation, etc- can be.)
1. Deals with external parties like contracts and approving and paying invoices.
1. Content that would violate confidentiality for a PostHog team member, customer, or user.
1. Legal discussions are not public due to the purpose of Attorney-Client Privilege.
1. Some information is kept confidential to protect the privacy, safety, and security of team members and applicants, including applications, background check reports, reference checks, compensation, termination (voluntary and involuntary) details, demographic information, and home address. Whistleblower identity is confidential. As we create them, People Group policies and processes will become public, internally and externally.
1. Performance improvement plans, disciplinary actions, as well as individual feedback, are confidential as they contain private negative feedback and negative feedback is 1-1 between team members and managers.
1. Partnerships with other companies are not public since the partners are frequently not comfortable with that.
1. Acquisition offers for us are not public since informing people of an acquisition that might not happen can be very disruptive.
1. Acquisition offers we give are not public since the organization being acquired frequently prefers to have them stay private.
1. Customer information is not public since customers are not comfortable with that, and it would make it easier for competitors to approach our customers.  If an issue needs to contain _any_ specific information about a customer, including but not limited to company name, employee names, number of users, the issue should be made confidential. Try to avoid putting customer information in an issue by describing them instead of naming them and linking to their SalesForce account. When we discuss a customer by name that is not public unless we're sure the customer is OK with that. When we discuss a competitor (for example in a sales call) this can be public as our competitive advantages are public.
1. Competitive sales and marketing campaign planning is confidential since we want the minimize the time the competition has to respond to it.
1. Plans for reorganizations are not public and on a need-to-know basis within the organization. Reorganizations cause disruption and the plans tend to change a lot before being finalized, so being public about them prolongs the disruption. We will keep relevant team members informed whenever possible.
1. Discussions that involve decisions related to country of residence are not public as countries are a core part of people's identity and any communication should have complete context.  The output of such decisions will be public.
1. If public information compromises the physical safety of one or more team members, it will be made not public because creating a safe, inclusive environment for team members is important to how we work. Information that might compromise the physical safety of a team member includes doxxing or threats made against a team member.

## Numbering is for reference, not as a signal

When taking notes in an agenda, in the handbook, or on our OKRs, keep items numbered so we can refer to Item 3 or 4a.
The number is not a signal of the importance or rank of the subject unless explicitly stated to be such.
It is just for ease of reference.

## Email

1. Send one email per subject as multiple items in one email will cause delays (have to respond to everything) or misses (forgot one of the items).
1. Always reply to emails by replying to all, even when no action is needed. This lets the other person know that you received it. A thread is done when there is a single word reply, such as OK, thanks, or done.
1. If you forward an email without other comments please add FYI (for your information), FYA (for your action), or FYC (for your consideration). If you forward an external request with FYC it just means the person who forwarded it will not follow up on the request and expects you to decide if you should follow up or not, the terms comes from [movie promotion to voters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Your_Consideration_(advertising)).
1. Emails are asynchronous, for example, if your manager emails you on a weekend it is fine to reply during the workweek.
1. If an email is or has become **urgent** feel free to ping people via chat referencing the subject of the email.

## Slack

We actively discourage the use of Slack as it is one time only communication that isn't leveraged.

Slack is to be used for informal communication only. Only 90 days of activity will be retained. Accordingly, Slack should specifically NOT be used for:
   1. obtaining approvals;
   1. documenting decisions;
   1. storing official company records or documents; or
   1. sharing personal or sensitive information regarding any individuals

### Avoid Private Messages
1. When using Slack for work-related purposes, please avoid private messages. [Private messages discourage collaboration](http://blog.flowdock.com/2014/04/30/beware-of-private-conversations/). You might actually be contacting the wrong person, and they cannot easily redirect you to the right person. If the person is unavailable at the moment, it is less efficient because other people cannot jump in and help. Use a public channel and mention the person or group you want to reach. This ensures it is easy for other people to chime in, involve other people if needed, and learn from whatever is discussed.
1. If someone sends you a work-related private message, it is okay to let them know you'd like to take the conversation to a public channel, linking to this section of the handbook.  The process might look something like:
  1. In the private message: `Thanks for reaching out, that's a great question/idea I think the rest of the team could benefit from.  I'm going to move this to #public-channel based on [our desire to avoid private messages](/handbook/communication/#avoid-private-messages)`
  1. In the appropriate public channel: `@Person asked "question" in a DM, pulling that out here if anyone else has input.`
  1. Answer the question in a thread on that channel message, allowing others to benefit.
1. If you find yourself getting a lot of private messages that should go in a public channel, consider changing your Slack status to an attention grabbing emoji and set it to something like:
  1. `Please consider posting in a public channel before direct messaging`
  1. `Why direct message me when you can post in a public channel?`
1. If you must send a work-related private message, don't start a conversation with "Hi" or "Hey" as that interrupts their work without communicating anything. If you have a quick question, just ask the question directly, and the person will respond asynchronously. If you truly need to have a synchronous communication, then start by asking for that explicitly, while mentioning the subject. e.g., "I'm having trouble understanding issue #x, can we talk about it quickly?".

#### Do not use group private messages
Use private channels instead of group private messages. Group private messages are very hard to maintain, track and respond to. First, consider whether the conversation can take place in a public channel. If not, please use a private channel instead.

#### Why we track % of messages that are not DMs

For all the same reasons that we want to [avoid private messages](/handbook/communication/#avoid-private-messages), [use public channels](/handbook/communication/#use-public-channels), and be handbook-first, we track the % of messages that are not DMs.
As we grow over time, we exponentially increase the lines of communication- 2 people have 1 communication line, 4 have 6, and 41 have 820.
As a result, there is a natural tendency for people to prefer private channels of communication.
The intentions are good, as people are looking to reduce noise for others, but this can lead to the same problems as described elsewhere on this page, notably:
1. communication is siloed
1. as we grow, people may be reaching out to the wrong person
1. if you have a question, other people might have it too

Slack is our primary source of chat communication and is where many personal interactions happen.
We want to continue to encourage folks to build personal relationships with one another which will often happen over DMs.

We know that DMs will always exist.
We don't want to eliminate them.
We set a target of Slack DMs to consist of less than 50% of messages.
At the time that we set this target, it is about 80% of communications.

Everything at PostHog is a work in progress, so if we see a culture shift where Slack is *not* where work is occurring, thus inflating the amount of communication that is personal that is occurring, we can always change this KPI, but the steady growth of Slack messages paralleling the number of team members does not seem to suggest that is the case.

The previous KPI (% of messages sent in public channels) was about public channels but since some necessary parts of the business occur in private channels (discussions around comp, hiring, recruiting- and we do A LOT of hiring), this version of the KPI makes more sense.
Earlier in our history, 50% of all communication *was* in public channels.

### Be respectful of your own time
1. You should try avoid information overload in order to be productive and efficient with your time. While it can be tempting to read every message in every Slack channel you subscribe to, it’s very challenging, not expected, and not necessary.
1. One method for avoiding Slack overload is to focus your Slack reading on Starred channels and Threads. Starred channels are like "favorites" and allow you to follow messages from those channels easily. Threads consist of any conversation in which you are mentioned and allow you to easily track conversations in which you have direct involvement.
1. Use your notification settings liberally. Depending on how you use Slack this could range from limiting notifications to critical messages outside of your working hours to turning off Slack notifications entirely. Find the right balance for you and stick to it.

### Be respectful of others' time
1. If you're only referring to someone, but don't actually need their attention, and want to spare them from getting notified, spell out their name normally without `@` mentioning them.
1. Slack messages should be considered asynchronous communication, and you should not expect an instantaneous response; you have no idea what the other person is doing.
1. Because we work globally, you may receive Slack mentions at any time of day. Please consider enabling [Slack's Do not disturb functionality](/handbook/tools-and-tips/#do-not-disturb-hours) so you don't get interrupted, for example, in your offtime.
1. Slack does not currently support automatically activating Do Not Disturb over weekends. Please bear this in mind if you choose to work over weekends, as your Slack message to someone may interrupt their time off. Consider using another form of communication instead.
1. Do not feel obligated to respond to Slack messages when you are not working.
1. Feel free to send a colleague a link to these guidelines if the communication in Slack should be done **asynchronously**.
1. **Please avoid using @here or @channel unless this is about something urgent and important.** In chat, try to keep the use of keywords that mention the whole channel to a minimum. They should only be used for pings that are both urgent and important, not just important. By overusing channel mentions, you make it harder to respond to personal mentions promptly since people get pinged too frequently. Additionally, if you are planning to `@mention` a specific team ([Slack User Group](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/212906697-Create-a-user-group#browse-user-groups-and-view-members)), consider the size of the group you are mentioning and the impact of pinging all of these people for the particular situation. If something is urgent and important:
   1. Use `@here` to notify all currently _active_ members in the room. Please only use `@here` if the message is important _and_ urgent.
   1. Use `@channel` to notify _ALL_ members in the room, irrespective of away status. Please only use `@channel` if the message is important _and_ urgent.
1. If you are aware that your teammate is on vacation, avoid mentioning them in a high volume channel. It will be difficult to find the information or question when they return. If you need to ensure they refer back to the thread, ensure to send them a link to the relevant Slack message through a direct message.

### General Guidelines
1. If the subject is of value to the wider community, consider commenting on an existing issue or opening a new [issue](#everything-starts-with-an-issue) instead.
1. Use the `:white_check_mark:` emoji or similar to indicate an inquiry has been answered. Anyone can add the emoji. If you're not sure, then feel free to leave it up to the person who asked. An emoji indicator is particularly helpful in channels where lots of questions are posted, such as `#questions`, and `#git-help`.
1. In general, you can think of emoji reactions as equivalent to body-language responses we use in real-life conversations, such as nodding your head as encouragement when a verbal (or in Slack, written) response might be too much.
1. In public channels, [threads](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115000769927-Message-threads) are valuable for keeping conversations together. If you want to respond to a question or comment in a channel, please start a thread instead of responding below them in the channel. This helps to keep the discussion in one place where it is easy to follow, and reduces noise as each message in a thread does not result in an unread message for everyone in the channel.
1. Unless you're in an active chat, don't break up a topic into multiple messages as each one will result in a notification which can be disruptive. Use [threads](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115000769927-Message-threads) if you want to provide extra info to the question/comment you posted.
1. If you are having a hard time keeping up with messages, you can update your preferences to have Slack email you all notifications. To change the setting, go to `Preferences > Notifications > When I'm not active on desktop...` and "send me email notifications."
1. If you agree in a message to start a video call (typically by asking "Call?") the person that didn't leave the last comment starts the call. So either respond to the "Call?" request with a video link or say "Yes" and let the other person start it. Don't say "Yes" and start a call 5 seconds later since it is likely you'll both be creating a video call link at the same time.
1. When referencing a Slack thread in a PostHog issue, don't _only_ link to the thread. Not only will people outside of the PostHog organization be unable to access the content, but the link will expire after the Slack retention period expires. Instead:
   1. **Review the contents** for confidentiality of users, customers, or any other sensitive information before posting.
   1. Copy and paste the relevant parts of the thread into the issue using blockquote formatting.
   1. Link to the Slack thread and include `(internal)` after the link. For example: https://posthog.slack.com/archives/C0AR2KW4B/p1555347101079800 (internal)
   1. Post a link to the issue note in the Slack thread to let others know that discussion has moved to the issue.

#### Are my direct messages and private channel conversations completely private?

In short, no. We fundamentally have access to them, despite not actively doing so.
Slack is the business-provided internal communications tool to use for collaboration and connecting with team members.
Please keep [PostHog values](/handbook/values/) in mind when communicating directly with other team members.
If you have a confidential personal issue that you do not feel comfortable discussing via a business-provided internal communications tool, it is recommended to use a personal form of communication such as a text message or phone call.

## Google Docs

Never use a Google Doc / Presentations for something non-confidential that has to end up on the website or the **handbook**. Work on these edits via commits to a merge request. Then link to the merge request or diff to present the change to people. This prevents a duplication of effort and/or an out of date handbook.

### Good Practices & Helpful Tips

1. If you have content in a Google Doc that is later moved to the website or handbook, [deprecate the Google Doc](#how-to-deprecate-a-google-doc).
1. When referring to a Google Doc or folder on the Google Drive in the handbook, refrain from directly linking it. Instead, indicate the name of the doc. If you link the URL people from outside the organization can request access, creating workload and the potential for mistakes.
(In the past, linking a Google Doc has led to inadvertently opening the sharing settings beyond what was intended.)
This also helps prevent spam from people outside PostHog requesting access to a doc when clicking its link.
1. If you are having trouble finding a shared Google Doc, make sure you [Search &lt;your domain&gt;](https://support.google.com/a/answer/3187967?hl=en) in Google Drive.
1. In our handbook, if you find yourself wondering whether it is better to provide a public link to a Google Doc vs. writing out the content on the website, use the following guideline: Is this document frequently adapted / customized? If yes, then provide a link, making sure that the document can be _commented on_ by _anyone_ with the link. For instance, this is how we share our employment contracts. If the document is rarely customized, then provide the content directly on the site and deprecate the Google Doc.
1. If you want to quickly find where a team member's cursor is in a Google Doc, click their icon at the top of the document and the app will jump you to the current location. This works in Sheets and Presentations as well.
1. You can set the notifications on a Google Doc so you only get emailed when someone tags you directly instead of getting emails for every comment. Click on "notifications" and select "Only yours". By the way, when you create the doc, it defaults to All, but when you are just shared with it, it defaults to Only yours. There is [no global default](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!msg/docs/1C3PZX1AY7Q/6EXXQKQSPCMJ).

### How to publish a Google Doc

1. Under the 'File' menu, go to 'Publish to the web'.
1. A new pop-up 'Publish to the web' will appear, click 'Publish'.
1. A confirmation will appear on the top of the doc, click 'OK'.
1. Back in the pop-up 'Publish to the web', a link to share will appear.
1. Add the link to the top of the document after the text: "Publicly shared via"
1. Use this link to share to your audience.

### How to deprecate a Google Doc

1. Add 'Deprecated: ' to the start of the title.
1. Remove the content you moved.
1. Add a link to the new location at the beginning of the doc/first slide/first tab.
1. Add a link to the merge request or commit that moved it (if applicable).

## Presentations

1. Please avoid presentations for internal use. They are a poor substitute for a discussion on an issue. They lack the depth, they don't add enough context to enable asynchronous work.

## Scheduling Meetings

1. If you want to ask PostHog team members if they are available for an event please send a calendar invite with Google Calendar using your Google PostHog account to their Google PostHog account. When you add a PostHog team member as a “Guest” in Google Calendar, you can click the See Guest Availability button to check availability and find a time on their calendar.  These calendar invites will automatically show up on all parties calendars even when the email is not opened. It is an easier way to ensure everyone has visibility to the meeting and member’s status. Please respond quickly to invites so people can make necessary plans.
1. Every scheduled meeting should have a Google Doc (for most meetings) linked. It should have an agenda, including any preparation materials (can be a presentation). Put the agenda in a Google Doc that has edits rights for all participants (including people not part of PostHog). Link the Google Doc from the meeting invite. Take notes of the points and todos during the meeting. Nobody wants to write up a meeting after the fact and this helps to structure the thought process and everyone can contribute. Being able to structure conclusions and follow up actions in realtime makes a video call more effective than an in-person meeting. If it is important enough to schedule a meeting it is important enough to have a Doc linked. If we want to be on the same page we should be looking at that page.
1. If you want to check if a team member is available for an outside meeting, create a calendar appointment and invite the team member only after they respond yes. Then invite outside people.
1. When scheduling a call with multiple people, invite them using a Google Calendar that is your own, or one specific to the people joining, so the calendar item doesn't unnecessarily appear on other people's calendars.
1. If you want to move a meeting just move the calendar appointment instead of reaching out via other channels. Note the change at the top of the description. This is easier because you can just see the new time in the context of your calendar.
1. Please click 'Guests can modify event' so people can update the time in the calendar instead of having to reach out via other channels. You can configure this to be checked by default under [Event Settings](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r/settings).)
1. When scheduling a meeting we value people's time and prefer the "speedy meetings" [setting in our Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r/settings).
   This gives us meetings of, for example, 25 or 50 minutes leaving some time to:
   1. Write notes and reflect
   1. Respond to urgent messages
   1. Take a [bio break](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/bio-break-meaning-and-origin)
   1. Stretch your legs
   1. Grab a snack
1. When scheduling a meeting, please try to have it start at :00 (hour) or :30 (mid-hour) to leave common start times available for other meetings on your attendees' calendars. Meetings should be for the time needed, so if you need 15 minutes just book that.
1. When creating a calendar event that will be used company wide, please place it on the PostHog Team Meetings Calendar. That way the event is easily located by all individuals.
1. When you need to cancel a meeting, make sure to delete/decline the meeting and choose the option **Delete & update guests** to make sure everyone knows you can't attend and don't wait for you.
1. If you want to schedule a meeting with a person not on the team please use [Calendly](/handbook/tools-and-tips/#calendly). Use Google Calendar directly if scheduling with a PostHog team member.
1. **Materials Review** are scheduled as all day not busy events as a reminder three days before the scheduled call.

### Common Meeting Problems

Meetings are incredibly expensive since they require synchronous time.
The most common meeting problems can all be address by following the above guidelines around scheduling meetings.
Some of the most common meetings problems are outlined below:

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Present instead of Q&A | Pre-record presentations on YouTube, so meetings are only Q&A |
| Meetings are used for brainstorming | People provide thoughtful proposals async |
| No agenda with edit rights for everyone | Ensure that every meeting has an agenda and is available for everyone to edit |
| People are late to meetings or don't have time to use the restroom between meetings | Use Speedy Meetings to give people breathing space before their next meeting |

## Indicating Availability

Indicate your availability by updating your own calendar using Google's ["out of office"](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/27/17510656/google-calendar-out-of-office-option) feature and include the dates you plan to be away in your automated response. Note that this feature will automatically decline any meeting invitations during the time frame you select.

1. Put your planned away time including holidays, vacation, travel time, and other leave in your own calendar.
1. Set your working hours in your Google Calendar settings.

## Video Calls

1. Use video calls if you find yourself going back and forth in an issue/via email
or over chat. Rule of thumb: if you have gone **back and forth 3 times**, it's time
for a video call.
1. Sometimes it's better to _not_ have a video call. Consider these tradeoffs:
   1. It is difficult (or impossible) to multi-task in a video call.
   1. It may be more efficient to have an async conversation in an issue, depending on the topic.
   1. A video call is limited in time: A conversation in an issue can start or stop at any time, whenever there's interest. It is async.
   1. A video call is limited in people: You can invite anybody into an async conversation at any time in an issue. You don't have to know who are the relevant parties ahead of time. Everyone can contribute at any time. A video call is limited to invited attendees (and those who have accepted).
   1. You can easily "promote" an async conversation from an issue to a video call, as needed. The reverse is harder. So there is lower risk to start with an async conversation.
   1. For a newcomer to the conversation, it's easier and more efficient to parse an issue, than read a video transcript or watch it.
   1. Conversations in issues are easily searchable. Video calls are not.
1. Try to have your video on at all times because it's much more engaging for participants
   1. Don't worry if you [can't pay attention at the meeting](/handbook/communication/#paying-attention-in-meetings) because you're doing something else, you are the manager of your attention. The flip-side of being the manager of your own attention is that others should not hesitate to request your attention when it is needed.
   1. It's okay to eat on video if you're hungry (please turn your mic off)
   1. You should ensure that you are properly dressed for all video calls. Properly dressed means that you are wearing clothing that covers the top and bottom parts of your body. We do not have a strict dress code policy, but want to make sure that all participants on video calls feel comfortable.  If you cannot be properly dressed for the entirety of the call, you should not join and watch the recording at a later time.
   1. Having pets, children, significant others, friends, and family visible during video chats is encouraged. If they are human, ask them to wave at your remote team member to say "Hi".
   1. Do not feel forced to have your video on, use your best judgement.
1. Additional points for video calls with customers or partners
   1. Results come first. Your appearance, location and background is less important than making customers successful so don't wait for the perfect time / place when you can engage a customer right away.
   1. Communicating that PostHog is an enterprise grade product and service provider is supported by the way you present yourself. Most of the time, if you would not wear something or present yourself in a certain way at a customer's office, candidate interview, or partner meeting in person then it's probably not the right choice on a video call with them either.
   1. Green screens are a great background solution. It's great to work in your garage or basement! Just get a green screen behind you and put up a professional background image to present well externally and still use the rest of the room how you want!
1. We prefer Zoom for video calls, especially with external people (it has fewer sound issues and handles low connectivity more gracefully).
1. Google Calendar also has a [Zoom plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zoom-scheduler/kgjfgplpablkjnlkjmjdecgdpfankdle?hl=en-US) where you can easily add a Zoom link for a video call to the invite
1. For meetings that are scheduled with Zoom:
1. As a remote company we are always striving to have the highest fidelity, collaborative conversations. Use of a headset with a microphone, is strongly suggested.
   1. If other people are using headphones then no-headphones works fine. But if multiple people aren't using headphones you get distractions.
   1. Reasons to use headphones:
      1. Computer speakers can cause an echo and accentuate background noise.
      1. Using headphones decreases the likelihood of talking over one another, enabling a more lively conversation.
      1. Better sound quality, avoiding dynamic volume suppression due to echo cancellation.
   1. Leave the no headphones to:
      1. People who don't have them handy at that time
      1. People from outside the company
   1. Suggested headphone models can be found in the handbook under [spending company money](/handbook/spending-company-money/equipment-examples/#headphones-and-earbuds).
   1. If you want to use your [Bose headphones](https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/noise_cancelling_headphones.html) that is fine but please ensure the microphone is active.
1. [Hybrid calls are horrible](#hybrid-calls-are-horrible)
1. Always be sure to advise participants to mute their mics if there is unnecessary background noise to ensure the speaker is able to be heard by all attendees.
1. We start on time and do not wait for people. People are expected to join no later than the scheduled minute of the meeting (before :01 if it is scheduled for :00). The question 'is everyone here' is not needed.
1. It feels rude in video calls to interrupt people. This is because the latency causes you to talk over the speaker for longer than during an in-person meeting. We should not be discouraged by this, the questions and context provided by interruptions are valuable.
This is a situation where we have to do something counter-intuitive to make all-remote meetings work. In PostHog, everyone is encouraged to interrupt the speaker in a video call to ask a question or offer context. We want everyone to contribute instead of a monologue.
Just like in-person meetings be cognizant of when, who, and how you interrupt, we don't want [manterrupting](http://time.com/3666135/sheryl-sandberg-talking-while-female-manterruptions/).
1. We end on the scheduled time. It might feel rude to end a meeting, but you're actually allowing all attendees to be on time for their next meeting.
1. Do not use the chat of products like Zoom to communicate during the call, use the linked document instead. This allows everyone to contribute additional questions, answers, and links in the relevant place. It also makes it easier for people in conflicting timezones to contribute questions before the call and makes it easier to review questions and answers after the call, which can be before watching the recording.
1. [Write down your questions](/handbook/values/#communication) in the agenda before vocalizing. Always ask people to vocalize their questions to provide the most detailed context and for any people that only use audio, for example listening to a recording of the call later while running.
1. You do not need to remind other people to vocalize their questions. Just say their name and a keyword of the question. 'Jay about credit-cards'
1. If there isn’t a note taker listed in the document at the start of the meeting, people should self-note-take. Consider asking other people to write down the answers in real-time to allow the person who asked the question to focus on the answer. The person asking the question can touch up the answer when the conversation has moved on to something less relevant to them.
1. Every comment is document worthy, even small support comments such as `+1` or `Very Cool!`.
1. We encourage the recording and sharing to our PostHog unfiltered channel. Todo: At the time of writing, this needs setting up.
1. It is unusual to smoke in an open office or video conference, vaping is associated with this. For this reason we ask that you don't vape during calls, and if you absolutely have to, kindly switch your camera off.
1. Speak up when you notice something is not working. If you notice someone's microphone, web cam or latency is causing issues for them it is good to speak up. On a video call it can be harder for the speaker to notice that they aren't being understood compared to a face to face conversation. As such you will be doing them a favour by speaking up early to let them know that they are having a problem. Also see [Hear nothing say something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ5spXU5HbU) for further explanation.

### You are the manager of your attention

You are the manager of your attention, and you decide when you do or don't pay attention in a meeting.

You will always have more work than time in your life.
If you get invited to a meeting you don't think you should go to, you should decline the meeting.
It is better to cancel than to show up and not pay attention.

On the other hand, not every part of a meeting is relevant, but it can sometimes be helpful to have more people in a call.
If you only have one discussion point, if possible, try to reorder the meeting agenda to have your point first and then drop from the call.
If you get asked a question when you're not paying attention, it is an okay use of time to repeat a question every now and then.

Don't use your camera to signal you're not paying attention; [cameras should always be on as far as possible](/handbook/communication/#video-calls).

### First Post is a badge of honor

You should take pride in being the first person to add a question to a
meeting agenda, however unlike [the First post
meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/first) we do want the first post to be
more than just "First!". The meeting DRI will be happy to see there is a
question ready before to kick off the meeting. The Meeting DRI should remember
to thank the person for asking the first question.

## Zoom

PostHog uses [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) for video communications.

## Hybrid calls are horrible

In calls that have remote participants everyone should use have their own equipment (camera, headset, screen).

When multiple people share equipment the following **problems arise for remote participants**:

1. Can't hear the sharing people well.
1. Background noise since the microphone of the sharing people on all the time.
1. Can't clearly see facial expressions since each face takes up only a small part of the screen.
1. Can't easily see who is talking since the screen shows multiple people.
1. Hard getting a word in since their delay is longer than for the sharing people.

The **people sharing equipment also have problems** because they don't have their own equipment:

1. Can't easily screen share something themselves.
1. Trouble seeing details in screen sharing since the screen is further away from them.
1. Can't scroll through a slide deck at their own pace.
1. Sharing people can't easily participate (view or type) in a shared document with the agenda and meeting notes.

The disadvantages for remote people are much greater than for the sharing people and hard to notice for the sharing people.
The disadvantages cause previously remote participants to travel to the meeting to be in person for a better experience.
The extra travel is inefficient since it is time consuming, expensive, bad for the environment, and unhealthy.

Theoretically you can have multiple people in a room with their own equipment but in practice it is much better to be in separate rooms:

1. It is annoying to first hear someone talk in the room and then hear it over audio with a delay.
1. It is hard to consistently mute yourself when not talking to prevent someone else's voice coming through your microphone as well.

## Google Calendar

We recommend you set your Google Calendar access permissions to 'Make available for PostHog - See all event details'. Consider marking the following appointments as 'Private':

1. Personal appointments.
1. Confidential & sensitive meetings with third-parties outside of PostHog.
1. 1-1 performance or evaluation meetings.
1. Meetings on organizational changes.

There are several benefits and reasons to sharing your calendar with everyone at PostHog:

1. Transparency is one of our values and sharing what you work on is in line with our message of "be open about as many things as possible".
1. Due to our timezone differences, there are small windows of time where our availabilities overlap. If other members need to schedule a new meeting, seeing the details of recurring meetings (such as 1-1s) will allow for more flexibility in scheduling without needing to wait for a confirmation from the team member. This speaks to our value to be more efficient.

If you add blocks of time spent on recurring tasks to your Google Calendar to remind yourself to do things (e.g. "Check Google Analytics"), consider marking yourself "Free" for those events so that coworkers know they may schedule a meeting during that time if they can't find another convenient time, or use the inbuilt "todo item" functionality.

## User Communication Guidelines

1. Keep conversations positive, friendly, real, and productive while adding value.
1. If you make a mistake, admit it. Be upfront and be quick with your correction. If you're posting to a blog, you may choose to modify an earlier post. Just make it clear that you have done so.
1. There can be a fine line between healthy debate and incendiary reaction. Try to frame what you write to invite differing points of view without inflaming others. You don’t need to respond to every criticism or barb. Be careful and considerate.
1. Assume positive intent and explicitly state the strongest plausible interpretation of what someone says before you respond, not a weaker one that's easier to criticize. [Rapoport's Rules](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Rapoport%27s_Rules) also implores you to list points of agreement and mention anything you learned.
1. Answer questions, thank people even if it’s just a few words. Make it a two way conversation.
1. Appreciate suggestions and feedback.
1. Don't make promises that you can't keep.
1. Guide users who ask for help or give a suggestion and share links.
1. When facing negative comment, respond patiently and treat every user as an individual, people with the strongest opinions can turn into the strongest supporters.
1. By default, discussions in issues and MRs are public and could include participation of wider community members. It is important to make the wider community members feel welcome participating in discussions and sharing their view. Wider community members also submit MRs to help improve our website/handbook and this is often their first contribution to PostHog. We want to make sure that we are responsive to their contributions and thank them for helping improve PostHog.

## Writing Style Guidelines

1. {: #american-english} At PostHog, we use American English as the standard written language.
1. Do not use rich text, it makes it hard to copy/paste. Use Markdown to format text that is stored in a Git repository. In Google Docs use "Normal text" using the style/heading/formatting dropdown and paste without formatting.
1. We use Unix style (lf) line endings, not Windows style (crlf), please ensure `*.md text eol=lf` is set in the repository's `.gitattributes` and run `git config --global core.autocrlf input` on your client.
1. Always write a paragraph on a single line. Use soft breaks ("word wrap") for readability. Don't put in a hard return at a certain character limit (e.g., 80 characters) and don't set your IDE to automatically insert hard breaks. Merge requests for the blog and handbook are very difficult to edit when hard breaks are inserted.
1. Do not create links like "here" or "click here". All links should have relevant anchor text that describes what they link to. Using meaningful links is important to both search engine crawlers (SEO) and people with accessibility issues.
This guidance should be followed in all places links are provided, whether in the handbook, website, GoogleDocs, or any other content.
Avoid writing GoogleDocs content which states - `Zoom Link [Link]`.
Rather, paste the full link directly following the word `Zoom`.
This makes the link more prominent and makes it easier to follow while viewing the document.
1. Remember that not everyone is working in the same timezone; what may be morning for you is evening for someone else. Try to say 3 hours ago or 4 hours from now, or use a timestamp, including a timezone reference.
1. Do not use acronyms when you can avoid them. Acronyms have the effect of excluding people from the conversation if they are not familiar with a particular term. Example: instead of `MR`, write `merge request (MR)`.
    1. If acronyms are used, expand them at least once in the conversation or document and define them in the document using [Kramdown abbreviation syntax](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#abbreviations). Alternatively, link to the definition.
