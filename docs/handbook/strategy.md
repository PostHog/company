# Strategy

> PostHog enables product led growth.

## Where will we compete?

PostHog wish to provide best in class product analytics, by appealing to developer and product teams.

We will target developers, rather than product teams to get implemented. There are a few key aspects to this:

* An open course business model
 * We have a zero friction route to adoption in both small, mid size and big companies.
 * We can go for breadth over depth in the product, similar to GitLab, letting the community fill in the gaps.
 * Being open core means we can aim for mass adoption with our free version, without worrying about competition from hosting companies.
* Tighter integration with developers' environments.
 * Feature flagging.
 * Working with existing databases and pipelines.
 * 1 click / 1 line install into production.
* Defensive product-team strategy - stay at parity with their features, but don't innovate here.
 * This means execution is much faster.
 * It will prevent most churn due to missing features from major tools that product teams will push for.

## How will we be the best?

* Engineering-led culture. Engineers want to deal with engineers.
* We will make the company remote-first, to encourage the greatest possible degree of community collaboration.

## What are our capabilities, and what else is needed to succeed on this path?

* We currently have a strong product for hobbyists or startups. We have enterprise interest but the adoption is weak.
* We need greater scalability for larger, greater value, enterprise customers to go into production. This will be key for either an adoption or revenue based Series A.
* We need a more innovative, developer-specific side to the product for all user types to move forward. This is what will make us truly best in class, and is also a pre-requisite to earn the right to impress teams in enterprises who demand the latest and greatest.

## What are the systems and metrics that empower our capabilities?

* Adoption: MAUs is something we should focus on. A tiny bit of product work needed to make that happen. Underneath this, we should start to look at the % of deployed:in production - that is our greatest area of drop off.
* MRR for revenue.
* Open company handbook - to enable a true remote and community first culture.

# Planning

## Planning - Pre-seed

> We believe in the power of product analytics, but the fact they are just targetted at product teams means there is much more that they can do.

* Build a product analytics tool that is at parity with Mixpanel/Amplitude or Heap.

Product analytics tools already have product-market fit. We believe that developers would also find them useful. Combining this with an open source approach will mean we get a lot of adoption very easily.

##Â Planning - Series A

Situation:

* We will have around $1.8M in cash.
* If the world goes into a significant recession, a "capital intensive" business may become a lot harder to fuel as LPs withdraw from VCs.
* We need to get to a series A from this money.

The series A could be one of the following:

* **option 1:** 90% adoption with some commercial proof
 * We have a ton of adoption and have demonstrated the commercial viability of what we're working on with a couple of enterprise customers for our premium features (ie $200K of ARR).
 * WAUs is our top metric
* **option 2:** focus on adoption
 * We have an enormous amount of adoption, and have put everything we have into this. We have no revenue.
 * WAUs is our top metric
* **option 3:** profitability
 * We focussed on profitability over adoption. We could aim for approximately $750K ARR of revenue, which would cover the costs.
 * MRR is our top metric
 *
