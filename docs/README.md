# Why PostHog?

## Understand each user's behavior

Before you build that next feature, understand how people are using what you already built.

##Â Know who is quitting your app

Create funnels - work out where users commonly drop out.

## Track which features are popular

Visualize trends in your product usage.

## The only developer friendly option

Full underlying data access.
Docker/Heroku or source deployment.
Host the entire thing with the rest of your product.

# Quick Start
