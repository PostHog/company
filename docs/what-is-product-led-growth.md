# Product led growth for engineers

PostHog helps engineers understand the impact of their work. PostHog also believes in product led growth - we aim to provide a playboook that is relevant and helps engineers implement product led growth principles into their own products.

## What is Product led growth?

Product led growth is the idea that you should use your product not a sales team as the main driver of user acquisition and beyond (in that this model flows through the whole user lifecycle).

Ultimately it is imperative that you have a **great** product - without this you won’t have users with which to drive further acquisition. All of our examples will focus on “great” products.

### Funnels - The old fashioned way

Traditional User Lifecycles have assumed funnel led growth as a way of increasing the users of your product.

This would mean **marketing** to your potential user base so they could become aware and interested in your product, a **sales** team to help that decision process by demonstrating or walking users through the product and then some form of after care once a user became a “customer”\*.

\*(A customer in this case can mean anything from a user who has deployed your product to making an actual purchase of your product)

It would look something like this:

![Sales Funnel](https://posthog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Sales-funnel.png)

This approach means to grow, you can focus on getting more potential users into the top of the funnel or getting a greater percentage of prospects through the various stages.

If you have no reference point for what that efficiency should be you might not ever optimize hence why qualitative tactics would be used to optimize that funnel - scaling a sales team, collaborating with marketing to work out why people drop out.

This itself led to the idea of commercial analytics software that would help marketing and sales professionals work out how to improve the ratio of people entering and exiting the funnel. 

Ultimately this model can lead to cognitive bias - it leads to a single result at which point the process must begin again. 

### The new way - a circular user lifecycle

Product led growth reimagines the user lifecycle as a circle with users at the center. 

![Sales flywheel](https://posthog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Events_Log-1.png)

Growth tactics will tend to work regardless of whether you follow the old fashioned way or a circular user lifecycle. However because your actions don’t aim to just move a user in a single direction and take into account continuous operation you can reduce friction in your onboarding process, and increase the speed at which you grow. 


Those funnel stages instead become:

**Understand / Attract / Acquire Users**

**Communicate / Engage / Activate Users**

**Deliver / Delight / Retain Users**

And by repeating this process you will increase user acquisition as retained users will help you attract new ones.

|   	|   Circular lifecycle	|   Sales funnel	|
|:-:	|:-:	|:-:	|
|   Pros	|   Places customers at the center - forces strategic changes on your product to massively increase growth.	|  Focuses tactical changes to user acquisition process to increase conversion. 	|
|   Cons	|   Strategic focus requires organizational buy-in.	|   Can be transactional, creates a lot of effort for 1 purchase or sale that must be repeated.	|


### Dropbox was excellent at Understanding / Attracting / Acquiring Users 

![Dropbox logo](https://posthog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/dropboxlogo.png)


The first step segment is attracting new users of your product - in doing so you need to understand why they use your product - ideally not “people use my product because x” but identifying the root causes of this.

[Think about the 5 whys used in Toyota's manufacturing process now used within Kaizen,lean manufacturing and Six Sigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys)

[Drew Houston (CEO & Founder) said](https://www.slideshare.net/gueste94e4c/dropbox-startup-lessons-learned-3836587) it was so important to know where their target audience was and speak to them in an authentic way to get real feedback.

![Dropbox HN Launch](https://posthog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/My_YC_app__Dropbox_-_Throw_away_your_USB_drive___Hacker_News.png)

Once Dropbox thought they understood their value they could apply tactics to acquire more users - Drew mentions that they spent more money on user acquisition than the return from those new customers (up to $388 for a $99 product). They had hired a PR firm, spent money on Adwords, hid their free version with referrals from paid search - all traditional tactics within a Sales Funnel.

But they still reached 1 million users 7 months after launch.

It took 14 months till they actually worked out where they were going wrong by thinking about a typical Dropbox User:

Hears about Dropbox from a friend, blog, etc and tries it > “I didn’t realise I needed this” > “It actually works” > Unexpectedly happy goes on to tell friends... 

So they tried a new strategy that focused on this - how can they amplify the organic growth their existing users were creating? 

They began to run surveys, split tests, and landing page / signup flow optimizations that helped test initiatives that encouraged sharing. In conjunction they put a big investment into analytics to track the progress.

1. Referral Program

![Referal image](https://posthog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/referal-link.png)

This was inspired by PayPal $5 signup bonus

Users who referred people who would sign up would gain increased storage space in their free version of Dropbox.

This alone permanently increased signups by 60%, and by January 2010 35% of daily signups were from the referral program. Note Dropbox knows the metrics inside out so they could speed up / reduce friction in their user life cycle by focusing on those tactics that worked best. In April 2010 users sent 2.8 million direct referral invites.

2. Shared Folders

By allowing one user to share a folder of documents with a non-dropbox user (who once they clicked the Dropbox link became a Dropbox user) they again increased their user numbers - as Dropbox grew from 100,000 users to 4,000,000 in 15 months, 20% came from shared folders and what Drew terms “viral features”

![Shared Folders](https://posthog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shared-folders.png)

A key takeaway Drew mentions is still building a great product - “Fortunately we spent almost all of our effort making an elegant, simple product that “just works” and making users happy” 

This drove growth despite the investment in an old fashioned funnel and it wasn't until they thought about users deeply and tracked their behavior did their growth rapidly accelerate.

When all was said and done their user growth was 3900% in 15 months.

### Zoom was excellent at Communicating / Engaging / Activating Users 

![Zoom logo](https://posthog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/zoom-logo.png)

Once you understand the value of your own product - how do you communicate this to your own users? 

This should also ensure you’re building the right features, something looks cool but if it doesn't attract or activate your users it won’t increase the number of users gaining direct value from your product.

Zoom’s stock price has recently jumped again but its initial activation strategy was excellent. In this stage it is important to communicate that value to your users - so that they can begin to get the benefits of your product soon. 

In our old model this would be done in sales demonstrations, relying on a sales person to effectively communicate how the product matched the perceived problems the users faced. In product led growth the product is expected to do this itself. 

For the most part this requires some sort of free trial / demo / freemium model so that users can test that value themselves. Zoom’s method was very successful because (as might become apparent with these examples) it attracted and in turn activated users - this was done through letting any users host a 40 minute meeting or less free - analytics suggested 45 minutes was the ideal meeting time.

![zoom example](https://posthog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/zoomexample.jpg)

The underrated part of this is that the freemium offering is very simple - ensuring customers understand what a paid version would include without limiting their ability to solve the initial problem is key to removing friction. 

Zoom had 3 millions meeting participants in 2013 - this was 30 million in 2014 and 100 million in 2015


### Typeform was excellent at Delivering / Delighting / Retaining Users

![Typeform logo](https://posthog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/typeform-logo-e1586796641495.png)

To keep the momentum of the wheel model - retaining the energy put into attracting and engaging your users to your product now must deliver on the promises you made when attracting them. 

This can be somewhat aligned with a “build it and they will come” idea but the key is to tie together the understandings you made when building the features to continue to delight your customers.

Typeform’s value proposition is simple - an easy way to build forms online, the idea stemmed from some design project work the founders had done. The idea had inherent virality - sharing forms means that your initial users will expose your product to other users and as such can grow organically. 

BUT this is a really crowded space - Survey Monkey, Google forms, Cognito etc, most people in this situation following a traditional sales funnel would look to shout the loudest / sell the hardest to make space. 

But with a focus on delighting users and making the product speak for itself Typeform retained them because it built the product for continued delivery of the value they initially understood. 

[The CEO himself focused on the "unique experience" of the user](https://saasclub.io/podcast/typeform-a-case-study-in-product-led-saas-growth-with-david-okuniev-230/)

“We were much more differentiated in the early days because everyone was just doing the plain vanilla forms. 
These companies doing feedback as...data collection will always be very focused only on the analysis of data, the actual collection through the form was just a means to an end. No company ever thought of actually making that into a great experience.”

![typeform gif](https://posthog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/typeform-example.gif)

Virality isn’t enough - the continued focus on developing something that will delight your users is key too.

 
Typeform ran in beta for 12 months to get this right - that product led growth approach did mean they jumped to $1m in annual recurring revenue 12 months after introducing a paid plan.
