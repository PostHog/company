# Communication

There is power in writing things down.

* It creates clear and deep thought.
* It is usually clearer than a conversation, so everyone can row in the same direction.
* It is very leveraged as we grow a large community and look to hire people around the world.

#Â Results

Everyone should help everyone else raise their game.

* Fatigue sets in when you complete a task. It's easier for outsiders to help those creating the work to raise their game.
* We are direct about the quality of work. That doesn't always mean polish:
  * The speed of a task.
  * The validity of a task in helping the company move forward.
  * The impact of a task.

# Iteration

If given a choice, go live.

* We are small, and can only win based on speed and agility.
* Going live forces a level of completion, on which you can build.
